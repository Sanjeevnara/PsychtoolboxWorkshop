    % screen, and we want equal numbers of each but in a shuffled order

    %0 - No output at all.
    %1 - Only severe error messages.
    %2 - Errors and warnings.
    %3 - Additional information, e.g., startup output when opening an onscreen window.
    %4 - Very verbose output, mostly useful for debugging PTB itself.
    %5 - Even more information and hints. Usually not what you want.
